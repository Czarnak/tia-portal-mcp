# MCP client configuration

Reference for configuring the server in an MCP client, including how block paths are
addressed. For first-time installation, see [Installation](installation.md).

## Block Paths

Prefer block paths returned in `browse_project_tree` node `Details.Path` values. Supported block path forms are:

```text
BlockName
PLC_1/BlockName
PLC_1/Blocks/Folder/SubFolder/BlockName
PLC_1/Units/UnitName/Blocks/Folder/SubFolder/BlockName
```

Legacy `BlockName` and `PLC_1/BlockName` paths are accepted only when the block name is unambiguous. If more than one block has the same name, use the deterministic `Path` returned by `browse_project_tree`.

## MCP Client Configuration

Configure your MCP client to launch the tool command:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tia-portal": {
      "command": "tia-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

For local development without installing the tool, point the client at `dotnet`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tia-portal-dev": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "{REPO PATH}\\TiaMcpServer"]
    }
  }
}
```

With an explicit project binding:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tia-portal-dev": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "{REPO PATH}\\TiaMcpServer", "--", "--project", "C:\\Projects\\Sandbox\\Line.ap21"]
    }
  }
}
```
